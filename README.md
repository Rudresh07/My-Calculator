Overview:
This Android application is a basic calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator provides a simple and intuitive user interface with buttons for digits (0-9) and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). Users can input mathematical expressions and view the result instantly.

Features Implemented:
Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are implemented to perform basic calculations.
Input Validation: The app ensures input validation to handle invalid expressions and prevent errors during evaluation.
Decimal Support: Decimal point (.) functionality is included to support floating-point numbers in calculations.
Clear Functionality: Users can clear the input field and reset the calculator with the "C" button.
Edge-to-Edge Display: The app utilizes edge-to-edge display to maximize the screen space available for the calculator interface.
Libraries/Frameworks Used:
AndroidX Library: AndroidX library components are used for UI development and compatibility across different Android versions.
exp4j Library: The net.objecthunter.exp4j library is used for evaluating mathematical expressions entered by the user.
View Binding: View binding is used to access views in the layout efficiently, providing type-safe access to UI components.
Setup Instructions:
To set up and run the calculator app:

Clone the GitHub repository: git clone <repository_url>
Open the project in Android Studio.
Build and run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.
Usage:
Launch the app on your Android device.
Use the buttons to input digits and perform arithmetic operations.
Press the "=" button to evaluate the expression and view the result.
Use the "C" button to clear the input field and reset the calculator.

Notes:
Ensure that the device has internet connectivity for dependency resolution during the build process.
This calculator app is designed for basic arithmetic calculations and does not support advanced mathematical functions.
